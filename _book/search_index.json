Mathematical Finance\nPreface\nThis book is designed to introduce some basic concepts in Mathematical Finance. The focus is the derivations of the Black-Scholes formula using Martingale approach and the Black Scholes Partial Differential Equations Approach. Related to the Black-Scholes formula, we will also discuss topics such as binomial tree, stochastic differential equations, Ito's Lemma, Martingale, asympotic analysis of the Black Scholes formula, and Black Scholes' Greeks, giving the readers a general overview on the origin as well as the application of the Black-Scholes formula.\nThe purpose of this book is not to review the rigorous mathematics behind the Black-Scholes formula but to give readers who have a reasonable background in Mathematics and Finance a basic and intuitive understanding in the very foundation of the nowadays Mathematical Finance. For this reason, the style of this book may be less technical but more on intuition. We will also try to make the text not only simple but also as concise as possible such that one can use the least effort to get the crux of the topic. Lastly, we also prepare some exercises with solutions from classic Mathematical Finance textbooks at the end of each chapters which may help you consolidate the understanding of the important concepts.\nThis book is based on the lecture notes of FINA3350 Mathematical Finance prepared by Dr. Rujing Meng, The University of Hong Kong.

Moreover, we will also introduce the structure of this book and how chapters are related. Hopefully this chapter will give the big picture and intrigue you to explore the milestone stone of the Mathematical Finance.\n\nWhat is the Black-Scholes Formula?\nBlach-Scholes Formula is an analytical option pricing formula which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-options. \nThe most important insight of the Black-Scholes Formula is that an European option can be priced regardless of its expected return from the investors which gives a single price that market participants are likely to agree. \nAnalytical pricing vs. Numerical pricing\nOption pricing includes 2 main approaches: analytical pricing and numerical pricing. Analytical pricing uses mathematics (often in great quantity) to derive an exact option pricing formula based on the model of asset prices, e.g. Black-Scholes Formula. On the other hand, numerical pricing uses computers and many repetitions of a simple procedure to arrive at an estimated option price, e.g. Monte Carlo Simulation. Note that Exact analytical solutions are rare, most of the analytical pricing formula have no closed-form solutions. Therefore, although numerical pricing may not be as elegant as analytical pricing, it is still widely used to price complex derivatives other than European options.\nThe Big Picture: How to derive the Black-Scholes Formula?\nThere are many ways to derive or interpret Black-Scholes Formula. The most common ways are 1) Black-Scholes Equation, 2) Cox and Ross Discounted Expectation, 3) Cox, Ross and Rubinstein Binomial Option Pricing. We now present summaries of these three methods. \n1.

Cox, Ross and Rubinstein Binomial Option Pricing (1979)\n\nThe Structure of this book\nTo build up the intuition of the Black-Scholes Formula, instead of following the timeline, we will learn the above 3 derivations in the reverse chronological order. \nWe first introduce the Binomial Option Pricing Approach. \n\nChapter 1: The Tree Approach I -- Binomial Branch starts by modeling the asset as well as the derivative price using a 1-step binomial model, i.e. Binomial Branch. It gives us the simple intuition of replication arguments and the risk-neutral probabilities.\nChapter 2: The Tree Approach II -- Binomial Tree further extend the one-step binomial model to a J-step Binomial Model, i.e. Binomial Tree. This model will give us approximations to Black-Scholes pricing.\n\nNext we explore the Discounted Expectation Approach\n\nChapter 3: Review of Probability\nChapter 4: Martingale Approach\nChapter 5: Pricing Foreign Exchange and Equities with Dividends\nChapter 6: Derive the Black-Scholes Formula by the Martingale Approach\n\nThen we derive the Black-Scholes Formula by solving the Black-Scholes Equation.\n\nChapter 7: Stochastic Differential Equations and Ito's lemma\nChapter 8: Derive the Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation\nChapter 9: Derive the Black-Scholes Formula from the Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation\n\nLast but not least, we discuss the basic implications of the Black-Scholes Formula by performing simple asympototic analysis. We will also briefly cover the topics such as Implied Volatility (Chapter 10) and Greeks (Chapter 11). This section is very important because it helps us understand the behaviour of the Black-Scholes Formula which is the basis of hedging and risk management.\n\nChapter 10: Asymptotic Analysis of the Black-Scholes Formula and Implied Volatility\nChapter 11: Deriving Greeks\n\nWithout further ado, let's get started.\n"},"Chapter_1_binomial_branch.html":{"url":"Chapter_1_binomial_branch.html","title":"Chapter 1: The Tree Approach I -- Binomial Branch","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1: Binomial Branch\nOutline\nThis chapter will:\n\nIntroduce the Binomial Branch\nIntroduce the Risk-Neutral Probability\nIntroduce the basic of Martingale\nIntroduce a 5-step risk-neutral derivative rule in the binomial branch framework\n\n1.

In probability theory, a \"measure\" is a mathematical function that allocates probability weight to outcomes in the sample space. Two probability measures that reassign probabilities to outcomes without changing the range of possible outcomes as called \"equivalent measures\".\nMartingale: A process X_t with respect to a measuure P if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n\n\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}^P[X_T | X_t, ..., X_0] = \\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}^P[X_T | X_t ] = X_t\n\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}^P[| X_T |]  for all T\n\nMartingale Measure: The measure that makes a process a martingale\nReal-world measure P: The measure that models the probability distribution of the market prices at a given future investment horizon.\nRisk-neutral measure Q: The risk-neutral measure makes the risk-free discounted stock price (as well as the risk-free discounted derivative) a martingale, also called \"equivalent martingale measure\".\n\nUniqueness of the measure Q: In a discrete-time world, for any stock process, there will be a unique measure Q under which the discounted stock is a Q-martingale\n\n3.2. How to find the measure Q?\nPremise: Measure Q is the measure that makes the risk-free discounted stock price a martingale\nIn the binomial tree model:\nGiven a tree structure, if we can find a measure Q that makes the risk-free discounted stock price process a martingale, then the risk-free discounted derivative will also be a Q-martingale. The price of the derivative today is therefore the expected discounted future payoffs at the risk-free rate under Q-measure\n4.

Expectation\nIf X is a random variable whose value is in the range of [a, b] and its probability density function (PDF) is f(x), then the expected value of X, denoted by \\mathbb{E}(X), is defined by:\n\n\\mathbb{E}(X) = \\int^b_a f(x) dx\n\nThe expectation of any function of X (denoted by p(x)) is defined by:\n\n\\mathbb{E}(X) = \\int^b_a p(x)f(x) dx\n\nProperties of Expectation\nFor random variables X and Y, and constants a and b\n\n\\mathbb{E}(a) = a\n\\mathbb{E}(aX) = a\\mathbb{E}(X)\n\\mathbb{E}(aX + b) = \\mathbb{E}(X) + b\n\\mathbb{E}(X + Y) = \\mathbb{E}(X) + \\mathbb{E}(Y) \nIf X and Y are independent, then \\mathbb{E}(XY) = \\mathbb{E}(X)\\mathbb{E}(Y) \nIf \\mathbb{E}(XY) = \\mathbb{E}(X)\\mathbb{E}(Y) , then X and Y are uncorrelated (but not necessarily independent)\nIf X and Y are not independent, then \\mathbb{E}(XY) = \\mathbb{E}(X)\\mathbb{E}(Y) + Cov(X,Y)\nCov(X,Y) denotes the covariace between X and Y\n\n\n\nConditional Expectation of a time-variant random variable\nConditional expectation of a time-variant random variable X(t), given the information X(s),  s , is usually denoted by:\n\n\\mathbb{E}(X(t) | X(s))\n\nIt means we take the expectation of a random variable X at a future time t, given the information of X at time s.\nOn the other hand, the conditional expectation of X(s) given the information of X(s) is:\n\n\\mathbb{E}(X(s) | X(s)) = X(s)\n\n1.2. Variance\nThe variance of X, denoted by Var(X) is defined by:\n\nVar(X) = \\mathbb{E}((X - \\mathbb{E}(X))^2) = \\mathbb{E}(X^2) - (\\mathbb{E}(X))^2\n\nProperties of Variance\nFor random variables X and Y, and constants a and b\n\nVar(a) = 0\nVar(aX) = a^2 Var(X)\nVar(aX + b) = a^2 Var(X)\nVar(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X,Y)\nCov(X,Y) denotes the covariace between X and Y\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation of a random variable X, denoted by STD(X), is defined by\n\nSTD(X) = \\sqrt{Var(X)}\n\n1.3. Covariance and Correlation\nThe covariance of any two random variables X and Y, denoted by Cov(X,Y), is defined by:\n\nCov(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}((X - \\mathbb{E}(X)))(Y - \\mathbb{E}(Y)) = \\mathbb{E}(XY) - \\mathbb{E}(X)\\mathbb{E}(Y)\n\nProperties of Covariance\nFor random variables X, Y X_1 and X_2, and constants a and b\n\nCov(a,b) = 0\nCov(a, X) = 0\nCov(aX, Y) = aCov(X,Y)\nCov(aX, bY) = abCov(X,Y)\nCov(aX + b, Y) = aCov(X,Y)\nCov(X,Y) = Cov(Y,X)\nCov(X, X) = Var(X)\nCov(X_1 + X_2, Y) = Cov(X_1, Y) + Cov(X_2, Y)\nIf X and Y are independent, then Cov(X,Y) = 0\nBut the reverse is not always true\nFor two joinly normally distributed variables X and Y, if Cov(X,Y) = 0, X and Y are independent\n\n\nIf Cov(X,Y) = 0 and Cov(f(X),g(Y)) = 0 then X and Y are independent\nf(X) and g(X) are any nonlinear function of X and Y respectively\n\n\n\nCorrelation\nThe correlation between random variables X and Y, denoted by \\rho(X,Y), is defined by:\n\n\\rho = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{Var(X)}\\sqrt{Var(Y)}}\n\nIt can be shown that  -1 \\le \\rho(X,Y) \\le 1.\nIf X and Y are linearly related by the equation Y = a + bX, then\n\n\n\\rho(X, Y) = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 &  b > 0 \\\\\n-1 & b \n1.4.

Normal Distribution and Central Limit Theorem\n2.1 Discrete Process vs. Continuous Process\nDiscrete Process: A process whose value changes on distinct, separated time points. For example, the binomial tree model describes the price of securities as a discrete process. The price changes at discrete time points with a fixed step size \\Delta t.\nContinuous Process: A process whose value changes at a real-valued time, allowing infinite divisibility of time. It can be precerived as taking a limit of a discrete process when \\Delta t\\to 0.
