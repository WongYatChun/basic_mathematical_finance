Mathematical Finance\nPreface\nThis book is designed to introduce some basic concepts in Mathematical Finance. The focus is the derivations of the Black-Scholes formula using Martingale approach and the Black Scholes Partial Differential Equations Approach. Related to the Black-Scholes formula, we will also discuss topics such as binomial tree, stochastic differential equations, Ito's Lemma, Martingale, asympotic analysis of the Black Scholes formula, and Black Scholes' Greeks, giving the readers a general overview on the origin as well as the application of the Black-Scholes formula.\nThe purpose of this book is not to review the rigorous mathematics behind the Black-Scholes formula but to give readers who have a reasonable background in Mathematics and Finance a basic and intuitive understanding in the very foundation of the nowadays Mathematical Finance. For this reason, the style of this book may be less technical but more on intuition. We will also try to make the text not only simple but also as concise as possible such that one can use the least effort to get the crux of the topic. Lastly, we also prepare some exercises with solutions from classic Mathematical Finance textbooks at the end of each chapters which may help you consolidate the understanding of the important concepts.\nThis book is based on the lecture notes of FINA3350 Mathematical Finance prepared by Dr. Rujing Meng, The University of Hong Kong.

Moreover, we will also introduce the structure of this book and how chapters are related. Hopefully this chapter will give the big picture and intrigue you to explore the milestone stone of the Mathematical Finance.\n\nWhat is the Black-Scholes Formula?\nBlach-Scholes Formula is an analytical option pricing formula which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-options. \nThe most important insight of the Black-Scholes Formula is that an European option can be priced regardless of its expected return from the investors which gives a single price that market participants are likely to agree. \nAnalytical pricing vs. Numerical pricing\nOption pricing includes 2 main approaches: analytical pricing and numerical pricing. Analytical pricing uses mathematics (often in great quantity) to derive an exact option pricing formula based on the model of asset prices, e.g. Black-Scholes Formula. On the other hand, numerical pricing uses computers and many repetitions of a simple procedure to arrive at an estimated option price, e.g. Monte Carlo Simulation. Note that Exact analytical solutions are rare, most of the analytical pricing formula have no closed-form solutions. Therefore, although numerical pricing may not be as elegant as analytical pricing, it is still widely used to price complex derivatives other than European options.\nThe Big Picture: How to derive the Black-Scholes Formula?\nThere are many ways to derive or interpret Black-Scholes Formula. The most common ways are 1) Black-Scholes Equation, 2) Cox and Ross Discounted Expectation, 3) Cox, Ross and Rubinstein Binomial Option Pricing. We now present summaries of these three methods. \n1.

Cox, Ross and Rubinstein Binomial Option Pricing (1979)\n\nThe Structure of this book\nTo build up the intuition of the Black-Scholes Formula, instead of following the timeline, we will learn the above 3 derivations in the reverse chronological order. \nWe first introduce the Binomial Option Pricing Approach. \n\nChapter 1: The Tree Approach I -- Binomial Branch starts by modeling the asset as well as the derivative price using a 1-step binomial model, i.e. Binomial Branch. It gives us the simple intuition of replication arguments and the risk-neutral probabilities.\nChapter 2: The Tree Approach II -- Binomial Tree further extend the one-step binomial model to a J-step Binomial Model, i.e. Binomial Tree. This model will give us approximations to Black-Scholes pricing.\n\nNext we explore the Discounted Expectation Approach\n\nChapter 3: Review of Probability\nChapter 4: Martingale Approach\nChapter 5: Pricing Foreign Exchange and Equities with Dividends\nChapter 6: Derive the Black-Scholes Formula by the Martingale Approach\n\nThen we derive the Black-Scholes Formula by solving the Black-Scholes Equation.\n\nChapter 7: Stochastic Differential Equations and Ito's lemma\nChapter 8: Derive the Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation\nChapter 9: Derive the Black-Scholes Formula from the Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation\n\nLast but not least, we discuss the basic implications of the Black-Scholes Formula by performing simple asympototic analysis. We will also briefly cover the topics such as Implied Volatility (Chapter 10) and Greeks (Chapter 11). This section is very important because it helps us understand the behaviour of the Black-Scholes Formula which is the basis of hedging and risk management.\n\nChapter 10: Asymptotic Analysis of the Black-Scholes Formula and Implied Volatility\nChapter 11: Deriving Greeks\n\nWithout further ado, let's get started.\n"},"Chapter_1_binomial_branch.html":{"url":"Chapter_1_binomial_branch.html","title":"Chapter 1: The Tree Approach I -- Binomial Branch","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1: Binomial Branch\nOutline\nThis chapter will:\n\nIntroduce the Binomial Branch\nIntroduce the Risk-Neutral Probability\nIntroduce the basic of Martingale\nIntroduce a 5-step risk-neutral derivative rule in the binomial branch framework\n\n1.

The CDF of the standard normal distribution \\Phi (a) and the PDF of the standard normal distribution \\phi(x) are therefore:\n\n\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^\\frac{-x^2}{2} \\\\\n\n\\Phi(a) = \\int^a_{-\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^\\frac{-x^2}{2}dx \\\\\n\nThe first order derivative of the standard normal CDF \\Phi(x) with respect to x (i.e. \\Phi'(x)):\n\n\\Phi'(x) = \\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^\\frac{-x^2}{2}\n\nThe second order derivative of the standard normal CDF \\Phi(x) with respect to x (i.e. \\Phi''(x)):\n\n\\Phi''(x) = \\phi'(x) = -\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^\\frac{-x^2}{2}\n\n\nTwo Important Properties of the Normal Distribution\n1. If X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2), then the random variable (aX + b) \\sim N(a\\mu + b, a^2\\sigma^2), where a and b are constants\nThis property enables us to transform any normal random variable X in to a standard normal random variable.\n\n   \\text{If }X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2), \\quad \\text{then the random variable } Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim N(0, 1)\n\nWe can also apply this property to find the cumulative probability of any random variable X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) using the CDF of Standard Normal Distribution by the following transformation:\n\n\nprob(X \n2.

Lognormal Distribution\nA log-normally distributed random variable is that its natural logarithm is a normal random variable, denoted by LN(\\ast).
