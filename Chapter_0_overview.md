## What is the Black-Scholes Formula?
Blach-Scholes Formula is an analytical option pricing formula which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-options. 

The most important insight of the Black-Scholes Formula is that an European option can be priced regardless of its expected return from the investors which gives a single price that market participants are likely to agree. 

**Analytical pricing vs. Numerical pricing**

Option pricing includes 2 main approaches: analytical pricing and numerical pricing. Analytical pricing uses mathematics (often in great quantity) to derive an exact option pricing formula based on the model of asset prices, e.g. Black-Scholes Formula. On the other hand, numerical pricing uses computers and many repetitions of a simple procedure to arrive at an estimated option price, e.g. Monte Carlo Simulation. Note that Exact analytical solutions are rare, most of the analytical pricing formula have no closed-form solutions. Therefore, although numerical pricing may not be as elegant as analytical pricing, it is still widely used to price complex derivatives other than European options.

## The Big Picture: How to derive the Black-Scholes Formula?

There are many ways to derive or interpret Black-Scholes Formula. The most common ways are **_1) Black-Scholes Equation_**, **_2) Cox and Ross Discounted Expectation_**, **_3) Cox, Ross and Rubinstein Binomial Option Pricing_**. We now present summaries of these three methods. 

### 1. Black-Scholes Equation (1973)


### 2. Cox and Ross Discounted Expectation (1976)

### 3. Cox, Ross and Rubinstein Binomial Option Pricing (1979)
